This is the laboratory implementation of a distributed privacy-preserving control algorithm developed in the master thesis: 

Privacy-Preserving Distributed Optimising Control of Water Supply\
MSc. Electronic Systems\
Aalborg University\
Spring 2024\
Authors: Fie Ã˜rum, Lau Lauridsen, Simon Johansen\
The thesis can be found at Aalborg University Library (www.aub.aau.dk)

To run the code, run the code in dedicated terminal in the following order: main_tower.py, main_pump1.py, main_pump2.py, main_return_water_and_consumption.\
Set use_low_level_control = False, to perform simulations without the laboratory.
